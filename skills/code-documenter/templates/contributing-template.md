## Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

Branch naming convention:

- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `fix/bug-description` - Bug fixes

- `refactor/what-changed` - Code refactoring
- `test/what-added` - Test additions

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-user-auth

### Making Changes

1. **Write code** following our style guide
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Update documentation** if needed
4. **Run linter:** `[lint command]`
5. **Run tests:** `[test command]`
