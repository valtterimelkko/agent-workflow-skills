# Documentation Depth Levels

Guide to choosing between **Standard** and **Deep** documentation depth.

## Overview

The skill offers two documentation depth levels:

| Level        | Word Count   | Coverage                      | Use When                           |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Standard** | 4,000-7,000  | Public surface + essentials   | Most projects, balanced coverage   |
| **Deep**     | 8,000-12,000 | Public + internals + advanced | Complex projects, teaching-focused |

## Standard Depth

### What's Included

✅ **Core Documentation:**

- README with quick start
- Installation guide
- API/CLI/Component reference
- Basic architecture overview
- Common use cases with examples
- Troubleshooting for frequent issues
- Contributing guide (for open source)

✅ **Coverage:**

- All public APIs documented
- Key configuration options
- Main user flows
- Common error scenarios

✅ **Examples:**

- 1-2 examples per major feature

## Transitioning Between Depths

### Starting Standard, Going Deep Later

Common path:

1. **Launch:** Start with Standard depth
2. **Users ask questions:** Identify gaps in understanding
3. **Contributors appear:** Need deeper architecture knowledge
4. **Scale challenges:** Performance docs become important
5. **Upgrade:** Run skill in Deep mode, preserves existing docs

### When to Upgrade

Signals it's time for Deep documentation:

- Contributors struggle to understand codebase
- Same architectural questions asked repeatedly
- Performance optimization needed
- Advanced use cases emerging
- Team growing and onboarding slower

---

## Word Count Targets Explained

### Why Word Counts?

Word counts provide concrete boundaries:

- Forces prioritization
- Prevents endless expansion
- Creates consistency across projects

### Word Count Includes

Counted:

- All prose in documentation files
- Code comments within examples
- Table content
- List items

Not counted:

- Code examples themselves
- Mermaid diagram code
- Markdown formatting

### Flexibility

Targets are guides, not hard limits:

- Simple projects may be under target
- Complex projects may exceed slightly
- Quality matters more than hitting exact count

---

## Choosing Wisely

**Start with Standard** unless you're certain you need Deep.

**Reasons:**

- Faster to produce and maintain
- Sufficient for most projects
- You can always go deeper later
- Over-documentation is burden

**Deep is investment:**

- Takes longer to create
- More to maintain
- Only worth it if users need it
- Better to start lean, expand as needed

**When uncertain:** Ask yourself:

- "Will users need to understand internals?"
- "Is this architecture novel or complex?"
- "Do I expect contributors?"

If all "no" → Standard is probably right.
