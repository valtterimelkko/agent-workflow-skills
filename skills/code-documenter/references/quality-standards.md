# Documentation Quality Standards

Concrete criteria for evaluating documentation quality. These standards guide
documentation generation and assessment.

## The Four Quality Dimensions

Documentation quality is measured across four dimensions:

1. **Coverage** (40% of health score)
2. **Freshness** (30% of health score)
3. **Quality** (20% of health score)
4. **Consistency** (10% of health score)

## 1. Coverage Quality

**Definition:** What percentage of the public surface area is documented?

### Scoring Criteria

| Score  | Coverage | Description               |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------- |
| 90-100 | ≥95%     | Nearly complete coverage  |
| 80-89  | 85-94%   | Good coverage, minor gaps |
| 70-79  | 75-84%   | Adequate, noticeable gaps |
| 60-69  | 65-74%   | Partial coverage          |
| <60    | <65%     | Significant gaps          |

### What Counts as "Public Surface"

**For APIs:**

- Every endpoint
- Every request parameter
- Every response field
- Every error code
- Authentication requirements

**For CLIs:**

- Every command
- Every flag/option
- Every subcommand
- Configuration options
- Environment variables

**For Libraries:**

- Every exported function
- Every exported class
- Every public method
- Every exported type
- Key configuration options

**For Web Apps:**

- Every user-facing feature
- Major UI components
- Configuration options
- Deployment process

### Quality Criteria for Coverage

✅ **High Quality:**

- Every public element has documentation
- No "TODO" or placeholder sections
- Examples provided for non-trivial elements
- Edge cases and limitations noted

❌ **Low Quality:**

- Missing documentation for key features
- Placeholder text like "Coming soon"
- No examples for complex features
- Undocumented breaking changes

### Example: API Coverage

**100% Coverage:**

```markdown
### GET /api/users/:id

Retrieves a single user by ID.

**Parameters:**

- `id` (required): User ID as UUID

**Response:** 200 OK [full response example]

**Errors:**

- 401: Unauthorized
- 404: User not found

**Example:** [working code example]
```

**50% Coverage:**

```markdown
### GET /api/users/:id

Gets a user.
```

---

## 2. Freshness Quality

**Definition:** How current is the documentation relative to the codebase?

### Scoring Criteria

| Score  | Freshness      | Description                               |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 90-100 | Current        | Docs match latest code                    |
| 80-89  | Mostly current | 1-2 minor outdated items                  |
| 70-79  | Somewhat stale | 3-5 outdated items                        |
| 60-69  | Stale          | 6-10 outdated items                       |
| <60    | Very stale     | >10 outdated items or critical stale docs |

### What Makes Docs Stale

**Code changed, docs didn't:**

- New features undocumented
- Changed API signatures not updated
- Removed features still documented
- Old examples that no longer work

**Indicators of staleness:**

- Git commits adding features without doc updates
- Inline code comments contradicting docs
- Examples using deprecated patterns
- Screenshots showing old UI

### Quality Criteria for Freshness

✅ **High Quality:**

- All recent changes documented
- Examples tested and working
- Breaking changes clearly noted
- Migration guides for major changes

❌ **Low Quality:**

- Examples don't run
- References to removed features
- Old version numbers in examples
- Contradictions between code and docs

### Example: Fresh vs. Stale

**Fresh:**

```markdown
### Authentication (Updated: 2025-01-10)

We use JWT tokens. As of v2.0, tokens expire after 1 hour.

**Breaking Change in v2.0:** Token lifetime reduced from 24h to 1h.

**Migration:** Implement token refresh. See [refresh guide](./auth-refresh.md)
```

**Stale:**

```markdown
### Authentication

We use session cookies.

[Note: This was true in v1.x but changed in v2.0]
```

## 3. Quality Quality

**Definition:** How well-written and useful is the documentation?

This dimension evaluates the documentation itself, not just coverage or
freshness.

### Scoring Criteria

| Score  | Quality Level | Description                                 |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 90-100 | Excellent     | Clear, complete, helpful, abundant examples |
| 80-89  | Good          | Clear and helpful, some examples            |
| 70-79  | Adequate      | Understandable but could be better          |
| 60-69  | Poor          | Confusing or minimal                        |
| <60    | Very poor     | Unclear, unhelpful, or misleading           |

### Quality Factors

#### Clarity

- Concepts explained before used
- Technical terms defined
- Logical flow of information
- No ambiguity

#### Completeness

- "Why" explained, not just "what"
- Edge cases covered
- Limitations noted
- Troubleshooting provided

#### Examples

- Working code examples
- Multiple examples showing different use cases
- Examples progress from simple to complex
- Examples are realistic

#### Usability

- Easy to navigate
- Good table of contents
- Cross-references work
- Searchable

### Quality Criteria

✅ **High Quality:**

- Multiple working examples per major feature
- Architecture Decision Records explaining "why"
- Troubleshooting section with real issues
- Diagrams for complex concepts
- Progressive disclosure (simple → complex)

❌ **Low Quality:**

- No examples, or examples that don't run
- Only "what" documented, no "why"
- No troubleshooting
- Assumes too much knowledge
- Disorganized structure

### Example: High Quality Section

````markdown
## Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse, all API endpoints are rate limited.

### How It Works

Each API key gets 1000 requests per hour. This counter resets at the top of each
hour (e.g., 2:00pm, 3:00pm).

### Why Rate Limiting?

We implement rate limiting to:

- Prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- Ensure fair resource allocation
- Maintain service stability

See [ADR-003](./adr/003-rate-limiting.md) for the full decision rationale.

### Checking Your Limit

Response headers show your status:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 742
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1641654000
```
````

### Example: Handling Rate Limits

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
  const response = await fetch("/api/users", {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
  });

  if (response.status === 429) {
    const resetTime = response.headers.get("X-RateLimit-Reset");
    const waitMs = resetTime * 1000 - Date.now();
    console.log(`Rate limited. Waiting ${waitMs}ms`);
    await sleep(waitMs);
    return makeRequest(); // Retry
  }

  return response.json();
}
```

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Getting 429 errors frequently

**Causes:**

- Making requests in tight loops
- Multiple servers using same key
- Burst traffic patterns

**Solutions:**

- Implement exponential backoff
- Use separate API keys per server
- Batch requests where possible
- Cache responses

## 4. Consistency Quality

**Definition:** Is documentation uniform in style, terminology, and structure?

### Scoring Criteria

| Score | Consistency | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 90-100 | Very consistent | Uniform throughout |
| 80-89 | Mostly consistent | Minor inconsistencies |
| 70-79 | Somewhat inconsistent | Noticeable variance |
| 60-69 | Inconsistent | Feels disjointed |
| <60 | Very inconsistent | Chaotic, confusing |

### Consistency Factors

#### Terminology
- Same terms used for same concepts
- No synonyms causing confusion
- Capitalization consistent
- Abbreviations defined once, used consistently

#### Tone
- Formal vs. casual consistent
- Second person ("you") vs. third person
- Active vs. passive voice

#### Structure
- Sections follow similar patterns
- Headers use consistent hierarchy
- Code blocks formatted uniformly
- Lists formatted the same way

#### Formatting
- Consistent markdown style
- Code syntax highlighting
- Link formatting
- Emphasis (bold/italic) patterns

### Quality Criteria

✅ **High Quality:**
- Style guide followed throughout
- Terminology defined in glossary
- Consistent section structure
- Uniform code formatting
- Same tone throughout

❌ **Low Quality:**
- "User" vs "customer" vs "client" used interchangeably

createUser(userData)
~~~

## Usage

You can make a new user like this:
```js
makeNewUser({name: "John"})
````

````

**Consistent:**
```markdown
## Getting Started

Install the package:

```bash
npm install myapp
````

## API Reference

### createUser(userData)

Creates a new user.

**Example:**

```javascript
const user = await createUser({ name: "John" });
```

## Usage

### Creating Users

```javascript
const user = await createUser({ name: "John" });
```

````

## Accessibility Quality

Good documentation is accessible:

✅ **Accessible:**
- Headings use proper hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Links have descriptive text ("see authentication guide" not "click here")
- Images have alt text
- Code blocks have language labels
- Color not sole means of conveying info

❌ **Not accessible:**
- Broken heading hierarchy
- "Click here" links
- Images without alt text
- Unlabeled code blocks
- Red/green as only diff indicator

---

## Testing Documentation Quality

### Manual Tests

1. **The Newcomer Test**
   - Can someone who's never seen this project get started?
   - Are prerequisites clear?
   - Do the quick start steps work?

2. **The Example Test**
   - Copy examples and run them
   - Do they work without modification?
   - Are all dependencies mentioned?

3. **The Search Test**
   - Pick a common task
   - Can you find the answer in docs?
   - Is it easy to find?

4. **The Link Test**
   - Do all internal links work?
   - Do external links resolve?
   - No broken references?

5. **The Completeness Test**
   - Pick a public API element
   - Is it fully documented?
   - Are edge cases covered?

### Automated Tests

**Link validation:**
```bash
# Script to check all links
./docs/scripts/validate-links.sh
````

**Example testing:**

```bash
# Run all example code
./docs/scripts/test-examples.sh
```

**Accessibility checking:**

```bash
# Check heading hierarchy, alt text, etc.
./docs/scripts/accessibility-check.sh
```
